# STA5069Z - Project

This project studies a crime data set from Boston, US, where the goal is 

- To analyze the spatial distribution of crime across different areas in Boston,
- To identify whether certain areas exhibit a higher prevalence of specific crime type,
- To determine the presence of distinct crime hotspots using multivariate statistical methods.

The data dictionary can be found in the "Data" folder. The folder "preivous-work" contains the topic ideas and project proposal, and the folder "presentation" contains the presentation that was held in class. Finally, written-report.rmd contains the code used to produce the results, and written-report.pdf is the written report.
